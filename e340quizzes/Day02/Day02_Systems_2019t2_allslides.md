Caldeira, 2012- Pre class reading
“One of the greatest uncertainties in climate prediction is the amount of CO2 that will ultimately end up in the atmosphere”
Some text from the Dec 2015 Paris agreement:
Emphasizing with serious concern the urgent need to address the significant gap between the aggregate effect of Parties’ mitigation pledges in terms of global annual emissions of greenhouse gases by 2020 and aggregate emission pathways consistent with holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C,

Systems dynamics: Stock & Flow
STOCK:  Amount or quantity of something residing in a particular place at a particular time
apples in a basket, water in a glacier, fish in the sea, knowledge in your brain…
FLOW:  The rate at which stuff adds or subtracts from a stock.  Since flow is a RATE, there is always an element of TIME included.
apples picked per hour, water melted per month, fish born per year,
knowledge GAINED PER 90MIN EOSC340 CLASS
INFLOW:  The rate at which stuff flows IN.
OUTFLOW:  The rate at which stuff flows OUT.
The STOCK, at any moment, is the result of the COMBINED HISTORY of INFLOW and OUTFLOW
Inflow
Outflow
STOCK

Systems dynamics: Stock & Flow
The RATE AT WHICH THE STOCK CHANGES, is the difference between the INFLOW & the OUTFLOW
If Flowin = Flowout
no change in stock over time
 EQUILIBRIUM
If Flowin ≠ Flowout  stock will change over time

FEEDBACKS:  Amplifying vs Stabilizing
AMPLIFYING FEEDBACK: A response to a forcing that pushes the system in THE SAME direction as the forcing pushed it. E.g. if a forcing increased global temperature, an amplifying feedback would increase global temperature further, which would keep the feedback process going.
STABILIZING FEEDBACK: A response to a forcing that pushes the system in THE OPPOSITE direction as the forcing pushed it. E.g. if a forcing increased global temperature, a stabilizing feedback would respond and DEcrease global temperature, which would stabilize the system (not necessarily at the original T).
Note: Some of you know “amplifying” feedbacks as “positive” feedbacks, and “stabilizing” feedbacks as “negative” feedbacks

After 10 years how many Gtons of carbon are there?  i.e.  what is y(10)?  Pick the closest answer.
2 Gt
5 Gt
15 Gt
20 Gt

Feedbacks link stocks and flows
Flow depends on a stock, which depends on the flow.
A perturbation could happen to EITHER the stock or the flow. The ramifications then feed back between stock and flow.
These are all “stabilizing” feedbacks

Climate Stocks & Flows
27

```




# Slide 27
```

Earth’s climate system is essentially a whole bunch of interconnected stocks, flows, and feedbacks.
The combination of inflows and outflows over time determines a stock.
Both stocks and flows can be perturbed.  When a perturbation happens, the system responds.
Perturbations in stocks can influence flows, which in turn can influence stocks again.
Perturbations in flows can influence stocks, which in turn can influence flows again.
4.   Amplifying feedbacks destabilize a system by reinforcing perturbations.  Stabilizing feedbacks counteract perturbations and help move a system toward a stable state.
