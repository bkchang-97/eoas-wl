Notes about emissivity:
Just because a body in equilibrium emits the same amount of flux as it absorbs does not mean that the outgoing radiation will be at the same wavelength (e.g. the ocean absorbs shortwave radiation and emits longwave radiation).
Different surfaces/layers have different colors because their reflectivity changes with wavelength.  For the same reason, their emissivites and absorptivities also change with wavelength.

Grey body radiation
‘Grey body’ is an approximation for a real body whose emission is different from a black body in a way that depends on wavelength.
We approximate this by a constant factor, the broadband emissivity, e, that is the ratio of the area under the true grey body curve c.f. area under the black body curve.  Grey body energy flux = esT4

BB with different T
15
As T increases
Peak of BB spectrum moves to shorter wavelength (or bigger wavenumber – see last time). Remember from the text book, the peak is at a wavelength of 2897/T (T in Kelvin) in mm. Check these peaks for yourself – my T = 5°C for mud, 37°C for Arnold and 80°C for hot coffee.
Curve has higher intensity at all wavelengths, so area under curve increases – we know it must b/c area under curve is equal to sT4

Greybodies: An approximation
Most real objects do NOT emit equally well at all wavenumbers (although water comes close in the longwave).
Instead, real objects radiate a fraction of the EM energy an ideal black body at the same temperature would radiate
We call this the “greybody” approximation:
I = εσT4
This is the RATIO of the actual energy emitted I to that which a blackbody would emit

Black vs. grey bodies
What is the point of the greybody approximation?  We get to ignore the details of the complex absorption/emission bands, and approximate their effect by a single number, the greybody emissivity e.  In climate models the radiation calculations typically use about 20-30 bands spanning the long and short wavelengths.

Need following information
Sun outputs 3.8 x 1026 W   (1W = 1J/s)
Mean sun-earth distance is 150 x 109 m
Area of the distance-sphere is 2.8 x 1023 m2
Energy received at the Earth is known as the “solar constant” and is   S = 1,360 W/m2
How much energy does the Earth absorb? Need radius of the earth  R = 6.4 x 106 m

Image credit: NASA
Solar constant is 1360 W/m2
At the top of the atmosphere directly facing the Sun, Earth receives 1360 W/m2
The Earth “blocks” an area in space equal to the area of a circle with Earth’s radius (pR2)
Each square meter of that imaginary circle gets 1360 W
Total energy received proportional to area of that circle
The TOTAL energy Earth captures is  1360 x pR2   [W]
Distribute total energy received over the surface area of the Earth: (1360 x pR2) / 4pR2   =  1360 / 4  =  340 [W/m2].
Aside: Trenberth was working with about 1365 W/m2 for the solar constant 341 W/m2

Summary
Balances of flows of energy in, out, and within Earth’s climate system determine Earth’s temperature.
We use the “grey body approximation” to estimate the emissivity/absorptivity of the atmosphere
Kirchoff’s law guarantees that ε=abs because otherwise we violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics
Solids, liquids and gasses emit radiation according to their temperature and their emissivity via the Stefan-Boltzman equation:  I = εσT4
These same objects absorb radiation with constant abs=ε that is independent of temperature.
That means that cold air can absorb radiation from a warm surface, but not re-radiate all that it has absorbed  This is heating because of the imbalance is called the “greenhouse effect”
This doesn’t violate the 2nd law because this system is not isolated – the surface is warmer that the atmosphere because it is absorbing sunlight that passes straight through air.

Cloud Albedo is Variable
NASA
THICK: more reflective (0.5-0.7)
THIN: less reflective (0.1-0.5)
38
Cloud reflectivity is one of the big unknowns that make predictions about future climate uncertain.  Will future cloud albedos be bigger or smaller?
The reflectivity of clouds is determined by water droplet density AND droplet size. Drop-for-drop, smaller drops have larger surface area to volume ratio. 
More SA = greater reflectivity.

IDENTIFY: “Amplifying” or “Stabilizing”
Necessary to distinguish between two types of feedback mechanisms:
The initial perturbation is dampened by the feedback mechanism  STABILIZING (negative)
The initial change (perturbation) is continually amplified by the feedback mechanism  AMPLIFYING (positive)

I am confused about question 3. Why do we need to average over the total surface area of the Earth to do this question?? The numbers given are already the averages.
How is the radius from the sun a determining factor in the solar constant?
Can you go over the calculations in more detail during class? We can do that
Why is it ok to assume that the earth's albedo is 0.3, when the surface areas of the different parts of Earth are so different (i.e. ALL desert, ALL snow, some land, some snow etc...)?   Averaging - it’s a model
If we were to approximate the average albedo of each of the hemispheres of the Earth, would we get significantly similar quantities?  Let’s come back to this
As well, why are power and energy used interchangeably in climate calculations? Which symbols do I use?  Context matters - be flexible - check units
Question 4 was difficult, I had difficulty understanding what the question was asking and how to approach it.  Do it at the end of class, IF we have time
How was Stefan Boltzmann inspired to study this?
