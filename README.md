This repository contains information about all the various tools and scripts as well as notes documenting their usage.

1. The first item to look through will be `md2canvas` which is a Python script that allows a Canvas quiz designed in a Markdown file to be exported onto Canvas bypassing the need for the instructor to manually set up the questions on Canvas itself. In it you will find some additional notes as well but mainly focus on the `examples` folder which contains sample quizzes that demonstrate how certain types of questions are formatted and how to format an actual Canvas quiz itself.
